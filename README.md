* Name: fractal_creator

* Title : Fractal Creator

* Description: 
This program is written in C++. 
This project creates a bitmap file and then applies two magnification functions 
to a sector of that file. The bitmap is a graphic image.
The graphic image is a fractal created by the the Mandelbrot Set.
A fractal in mathematics is an abstract object used to describe 
and simulate naturally occurring objects. Fractals can also be nearly the 
same at different levels. 
This latter pattern is illustrated in magnifications of the Mandelbrot set.
Mandelbrot set a set of points in the complex plane that is self-replicating 
according to some predetermined rule such that the boundary of the set has 
fractal dimensions, used in the study of fractal geometry and in producing 
patterns in computer graphics.
A demonstration project at present, 
although may be expanded in future.
